# Frameworkless Java demo

## TL;DR Setup
This project is currently written for Java 21.
If you want to make it work on IntelliJ, here's what you gotta do:

1. Go to Settings > Java Compiler > Add you project as module, with compiler under `21` and compiler options `--enable-preview`
2. Go to Run Configurations (Application) > On Modify Options> Add VM Options > Insert `--enable-preview` on the newly empty box

Now the project is ready to run with the preview features from Java 21.

## Tinyword
Hello, stranger! 
First of all, thanks for finding this repo.
Second, thank yourself for finding this repo.
If you wanna go rogue in this world full of frameworks, this repository might help you to get up to speed.

For the moment, and while I am writing the first few commits, this repository is very tiny.
Nonetheless, my ambition is to produce a future reference for quality production-ready frameworkless template.
